# Deeplearning_assignment_1
Annika and Mikkels submission for assingment 1 in deep learning

We have chosen to work with a dataset about breast cancer found on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/breast-cancer-dataset.

We have made a neural network that can predict weather a tumor is cancerous or not based on 10 imput features.

Our neural network has a 92% accuracy in the test-data, only mis-classifying one tumor as non-cancerous but in reality it was cancerous.
